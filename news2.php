        <h1>Anomaly Scan at Care Compass Hospital</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Pregnancy is a remarkable journey filled with excitement and anticipation, but it also comes with its fair share of concerns. 
            At Care Compass Hospital, we are committed to providing expectant parents with the confidence and peace of mind they deserve

        </p>

        <h2>What Is an Anomaly Scan?</h2>
        <p>An anomaly scan, also known as a fetal anomaly scan or second-trimester scan, is a vital part of prenatal diagnostics 
            typically performed between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. This detailed ultrasound assesses the development of the baby 
            and identifies any structural abnormalities. It provides critical insights into the babyâ€™s overall growth, organ development, 
            and placental health, helping doctors plan for a safe delivery and addressing any potential issues early.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Care Compass Hospital for Your Anomaly Scan?</h2>

        <h2>What Does the Anomaly Scan Check For?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The anomaly scan examines several key aspects of fetal development, including:</li>
            <li><strong>Brain and Skull Development:</strong> Ensuring the babyâ€™s brain and head are developing normally.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Function:</strong> Checking the structure and rhythm of the babyâ€™s heart.</li>
            <li><strong>Limbs and Spine:</strong> Assessing the babyâ€™s arms, legs, and spinal alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Abdomen and Organs:</strong> Reviewing the stomach, kidneys, bladder, and other internal organs.</li>
            <li><strong>Placenta and Amniotic Fluid:</strong> Monitoring the placentaâ€™s position and the amniotic fluid levels to ensure a 
                healthy environment for the baby.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beyond the Scan: Comprehensive Prenatal Care</h2>
        <p>At Care Compass Hospital, the anomaly scan is just one part of our holistic prenatal care program. 
            Our multidisciplinary team provides support for every aspect of your pregnancy, from nutrition and mental health to expert 
            consultations for high-risk pregnancies.</p>
