                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    For over seven decades, Care Compass Hospitals has been a pillar of trust and excellence in Sri Lankan healthcare. 
                    Established in 2003, we have continuously evolved to meet the ever-growing medical needs of our community, 
                    always guided by our core belief: "Healing with Compassion, Leading with Innovation."
                </p>
                <p>
                    From humble beginnings, we have grown into a world-class tertiary care institution, providing cutting-edge medical treatments,
                     state-of-the-art facilities, and a dedicated team of professionals who prioritize patient well-being above all else. 
                     With a capacity of 260 beds, including 60 critical care units, our hospital offers spacious, modern rooms designed for 
                     patient comfort and care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Care Compass, we take pride in offering advanced medical technology and pioneering treatments that set new standards in healthcare. 
                    Our ultramodern theatre complex houses eight operating rooms equipped for the most sophisticated surgeries, supported by state-of-the-art 
                    intensive care units (ICUs), a modern radiology department, a fully equipped physiotherapy unit, and two advanced catheterization laboratories.

                    Our Cardiac Centre of Excellence is among the finest in the region, providing comprehensive cardiac care, from early diagnostics to
                     complex surgical interventions and post-operative rehabilitation. With 15 dedicated cardiac care beds, world-class infrastructure, 
                     and a team of leading cardiologists and heart surgeons, we ensure the highest level of cardiac treatment for our patients.
